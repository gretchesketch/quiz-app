I created my place holder question with 4 answer options in the html. I will use JavaScript for the actual question and answer content.

Used futurama inspired colors (not exact) for the color theme in the stylesheet. Added some interactive affects with the submit button.

I have all my questions and snwers stored in an array in the js file. used the deselectAnswer function to assure that no answer is seleceted when the question first apears on the screen. The submit button is also disabled until an answer has been selected. I used the ids from the html to hook into the javascript and make variables with them. I use these to pull and display the questions and answers from the array. using a getselected function I am able to select one answer that will be judged to be either correct or inccorect using if stataments based on what correct letter was in teh array. If there are more questions to be answered once the user has selected an option and clicked the subbmit button it wil trigger the next question. This will happen until there are no more questions to be pulled from the array. Once at the end your score will be visible.

used local storage to set the score and users name to be displayed, however still have not gotten it to be displayed.
